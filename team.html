I am an Associate Professor at the University of Tartu and an Adjunct Associate Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. My research takes place at the intersection between human-computer interaction, information systems, and software engineering and focuses on understanding and developing means to support collaboration in corporate, entrepreneurial, civic, educational, and scientific settings. I have participated in, co-organized, served as a mentor, and studied countless hackathons over the past years with no end in sight. Outside of work, I like to fiddle with any gadget I can get my hand on, play video games, cook, and do BBQ. You can find out more about my work here: https://alexandernolte.github.io/</p>

I'm an Associate Astronomer (w/o Tenure) at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD, USA. My research focuses on two interconnected areas: near-field cosmology using dwarf galaxies in the local universe, and open source research software for astronomy.  I also have a mission-support role as the Project Scientist of the Data Science Mission Office. As part of all these roles I have organized several hackathons and participated in many others. I am also an incorrigible punster, and enjoy taking apart and (sometimes) putting back together electronic gadgets of all sorts. You can see more about me at https://eteq.github.io/.</p>

I train researchers on topics from introductory coding to advanced bioinformatics analysis.   I also started an LLC BioData Sage. I offer data science strategic planning, including the usage of appropriate tools, platforms, datasets, and reproducible practices. I also work with clients in industry, academia, government, and the nonprofit sector creating and supporting training programs on data science, cloud computing, and the tools and standards for reproducible data science practices for scientific and lay communities. I am a community manager for various programs and projects creating community events such as hackathons to bring together diverse communities toward solving real biomedical data challenges. I worked at NIH for over ten years and most recently served as the workforce development and community engagement lead for the Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS). I have focused specifically on lowering the barriers of entry for data science and cloud computing by building train-the-trainer programs for STEM educators as well as facilitating data science training programs for low-resourced schools.  I  received my Ph.D. in computational neuroscience as part of the graduate partnership program between NIH and the Karolinska Institute, Sweden, in 2014.</p>

I also hold guest appointments as a Senior Data Science fellow at the eScience Institute and as Affiliate Faculty at the Digital Arts and Experimental Media Department, both at the University of Washington.
I am particularly interested in how we can use modern statistical tools and machine learning methods to learn about the universe.  Within SRON as well as in my role as an organizer of Astro Hack Week, I am very interested in how we can facilitate communication and collaboration both within and between scientific communities, and how we can help scientists learn and use modern data science methods. Previously, I was the Associate Director for the DIRAC Institute at the University of Washington, Seattle, after three years as a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow at New York University's Center for Data Science. Before that, I completed a PhD thesis on magnetar bursts with Anna Watts and Michiel van der Klis at the Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy of the University of Amsterdam.</p>
