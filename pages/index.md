> “Hack the Hackathon” is a global community of hackathon organizers, participants, and researchers. We come from many corners of society, including academia, industry, non-profits, and government organizations. What unites us is a deep curiosity about how humans collaborate and build things together and the belief that hackathons and similar events can help us solve important societal and scientific problems and that they can aid us in creating supportive and equitable communities around shared challenges.

> We are a loose collective, partly organized via Discord and through a yearly “Hack the Hackathon” workshop. If, like us, you are excited to share insights, discuss current practices, address open challenges, and explore the future of hackathons, we invite you to join us!
