# About Hack the Hackathon

## What is â€˜Hack the Hackathon?â€™
An unconference series and interdisciplinary community exploring scientific collaboration, learning, and civic engagement through hackathons.

## What is a Hackathon?
Hackathons are "time-bounded participant-driven events that are organized to foster specific goals or objectives. [...] People that participate in an event often have different backgrounds and bring different expertise. Their primary motivation to join an event is to work on a shared team project that interests them [...]. During the event, teams attempt to create an artifact that can be shared with other participants."

## What is an Unconference?
An unconference is essentially a conference without predefined topics. There is a high-level structure and theme, but actual topics are generated by the participants on the spot. Breakout groups are formed dynamically based on interest and relevance.

## How did this start?
Hack the Hackathon began with the realization that hackathons are interdisciplinary and run in diverse spaces and communities. We aimed to create a space for anyone interested in organizing such events to collaborate, share resources, and learn from each other.

Two separate groups were working on hackathon planning kits, both supported by funding from the Sloan Foundation. These groups were brought together, and the first Hack the Hackathon was born.
