                <p>
                    Hackathons are "time-bounded participant-driven events that are organized to foster specific goals or objectives. [...] People that participate in an event often have different backgrounds and bring different expertise. Their primary motivation to join an event is to work on a shared team project that interests them [...]. During the event, teams attempt to create an artifact that can be shared with other participants."

                <p>An unconference is essentially a conference without predefined topics. There is a high-level structure and theme, but actual topics are generated by the participants on the spot. Breakout groups are formed dynamically based on interest and relevance.</p>

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Hack the Hackathon began with the realization that hackathons are interdisciplinary and run in diverse spaces and communities. We aimed to create a space for anyone interested in organizing such events to collaborate, share resources, and learn from each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two separate groups were working on hackathon planning kits, both supported by funding from the Sloan Foundation. These groups were brought together, and the first Hack the Hackathon was born.
