							<p>
							Time-bounded events such as hackathons, hackweeks, data dives, codefests, edit-a-thons and 
							others have experienced a steep rise in popularity during the past decade. They started as 
							competitive coding events in the early 2000s during which young developers formed small ad-hoc 
							teams and engaged in short-term intense collaboration on projects that are of interest to them. 
							Since then these events have proliferated into various domains including (scientific) communities, 
							small, medium and large corporations, entrepreneurship, (higher) education, civic engagement and 
							others. The extension into different domains also has broadened their focus ranging from fostering 
							innovation and creating technical solutions to covering themes such as tackling social and 
							environmental issues, supporting informal and collaborative learning and creating new or expanding 
							and connecting existing communities. 
							</p>
							<p>
							Scientific communities in particular have embraced these events as an opportunity for researchers 
							to acquire skills outside their discipline and form cross-disciplinary collaborations. Such 
							activities are necessary because many impactful discoveries are occurring at the interface between 
							traditional scientific disciplines and statistics, computing and data science. Traditional structures 
							of scientific communication, education and exchange of knowledge often fall short in providing sufficient 
							support mechanisms for such collaborations though.
							</p>
							<p>
							In recent years, practitioners and researchers have acquired significant (practical) knowledge 
							organizing and studying hackathon events. However, our understanding of motivations and best 
							practices is largely limited to single domains and remains siloed. What is currently missing is 	
							a higher-level view of the common motivations, goals, and best practices for scientific hackathons. 
							Similarly, it is instructive to uncover and understand differences between how different communities 
							organize events in relation to their goals.
							While there were attempts in the past to organize workshops in specific domains that brought 
							researchers and practitioners together, those attempts focused on a specific community. Understanding 
							hackathons, uncovering their strengths and flaws and developing means to support organizers, 
							participants and other stakeholders to successfully prepare, run and follow-up on an event is however 
							not a task a single community can fulfill.
							</p>
							<p> 
							With this ongoing series of workshops we aim to bring together researchers and practitioners 
							of hackathons and related events to meet and discuss the current state of practice and research 
							around hackathons as well as future challenges. Our main purpose is to bring together the broad 
							and expansive community of people who organize hackathons in both scientific and civic contexts, 
							who study hackathons and their participants, and foster a growing and interdisciplinary community 
							of learning and practice. What started with informal conversations between four hackathon 
							organizers and researchers has grown into an ongoing workshop series and a number of ongoing 
							projects. But we also know that our current reach is limited, and we are always looking to connect 
							with any folks who are excited to think about how to organize these events, and how to make them 
							welcoming spaces.
